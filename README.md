# Express-Gateway test instance

## What's up?

This is a sample [Express Gateway](https://express-gateway.io) instance deployed on
Glitch showing how you can DRY your configuration files using references in YAML
files.

It is configured with couple of policies (`jwt`, `oauth2`) to secure some endpoints
and the Admin API is (insecurely) exposed on the web.

_Enjoy it_
